Salinan maklumat ringkas:

> When viewed, any .csv or .tsv file committed to a GitHub repository
> automatically renders as an interactive table, complete with headers
> and row numbering. By default, we'll always assume the first row is
> your header row.
> 
> You can link to a particular row by clicking the row number, or
> select multiple rows by holding down the shift key. Just copy the URL
> and send it to a friend.

> Common errors include:
> - Mismatched column counts. You must have the same number of
> separators in each row, even if the cell is blank
> - Exceeding the file size. Our rendering only works for files
> up to 512KB. Anything bigger than that slows down the browser.
